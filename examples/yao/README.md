# Yao live coding

This is a live coding for quantum simulator `Yao.jl`.

## To generate live coding

```bash
bash cast.sh
```

## To play

If you have asciinema installed already in your system, the generated `.cast` file can be played directly with which.

Otherwise, the most convenient way to play the clip is to upload it to a Github repo and use the javascript to play the clip. You might want to check the file [`demopage.html`](demopage.html).
